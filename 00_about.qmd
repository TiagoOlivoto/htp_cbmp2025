This material contains the scripts and data needed to reproduce the examples seen in the **pliman and plimanshiny package for High-throughput phenotyping** course held on 13º Brazilian Plant Breeding Congress

# Software

To reproduce the examples in this material, you will need the latest versions o R and RStudio (Portuguese).

<a class="btn btn-success" href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-save"></i> Download R</a>

<a class="btn btn-success" href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-save"></i> Download RStudio</a>

# Restoring the R environment with renv
This command will install all required packages with the exact versions recorded in the `renv.lock` file. 


```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("renv")
renv::activate()
renv::restore()
```



If you later add new packages, run:
```{r eval = FALSE}
renv::snapshot()

```



# Citation

To cite the pliman package in your works, use the following reference:

>  Olivoto T (2022). “Lights, camera, pliman! An R package for plant image analysis.” **Methods in Ecology
  and Evolution**, 13(4), 789-798. doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13803 <https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13803>.

```{r}
citation("pliman")
```

# Scripts

The .zip file contains a folder with the static website, structured as follows:

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(fs)
fs::dir_tree("D:/htp_cbmp2025", recurse = 1)
```

The material in HTML (\_site/index.html) will give you access to the site, where you can view all examples, with codes and outputs. To reproduce the material, simply use the \*.qmd files.

For reproduction, it is suggested to set the `htp_cbmp2025` folder as the default directory. You can easily set the directory by running the following command, assuming you have the `00_about.qmd` script open.

```{r eval=FALSE}
pliman::set_wd_here()
```


# Acknowledgments

The availability of these mosaics is essential for the continued improvement of tools like {pliman}. I would like to extend my gratitude to [\@FilipeMathias](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipe-matias-27bab5199/) and [Alcinei Azevedo](https://www.expstat.com/) for providing various materials related to high-throughput phenotyping, and to [\@MaiconNardino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maicon-nardino-091253268/) and [\@CaiqueSilva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caique-machado-e-silva-404415154/) from UFV for providing the multispectral orthomosaics of the wheat field.

Additionally, special thanks to [Arthur Bernardeli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-bernardeli-5a1a0b5a/) for providing the digital surface models, digital terrain models, and masks related to the soybean fields, and [Gustavo Nandi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustavo-nandi-035905127/) for providing the orthomosaic from a potato breeding field.

# Similar tools

This course will primarily focus on the {pliman} and {plimanShiny} R packages. However, these are not the only tools available for high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) in R. I highly recommend exploring the pioneering R package [FIELDimageR](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/FIELDimageR), as well as its complementary extensions [FIELDimageR-Extra](https://github.com/filipematias23/FIELDimageR.Extra) and [FIELDimageR-QGIS](https://github.com/filipematias23/FIELDimageR-QGIS), which offer additional functionalities for enhanced HTP analysis.
